This is probably the most basic full-stack app youâ€™ve ever seen. I just built it to try out some vibe coding.

To use it: 
  (1) Go to the project folder
  (2) Start the backend server by typing node server.js to the terminal.
  (3) Now, open a new terminal. Go to the client folder /notes-app-vibe-coded/client.
  (4) Start the frontend by typing npm start.
  (5) Go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

Thanks.
