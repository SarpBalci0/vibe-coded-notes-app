**package.json**:
    express:
        What it is: A web framework for Node.js
        Why we need it: Makes it easy to create a web server and API endpoints
        What it does:
            Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE)
            Routes requests to the right code
            Sends responses back to the frontend
    sqlite:
        database driver
    cors:
        What it is: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware
        Why we need it: Browsers block requests between different ports by default
        What it does:
            Our React app runs on localhost:3000
            Our backend runs on localhost:3001
            CORS allows them to communicate
Install dependencies: Run npm install to download the libraries inside the package.json. 
Result: A node_modules folder appears with all the code we need
Purpose: Sets up the foundation so your backend can create a web server, talk to a database, and communicate with your frontend
